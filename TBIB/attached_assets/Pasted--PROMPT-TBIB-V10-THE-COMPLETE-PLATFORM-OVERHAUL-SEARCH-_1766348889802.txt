🧬 PROMPT TBIB V10: THE COMPLETE PLATFORM OVERHAUL (SEARCH-FIRST & PURE UI)
Role: Senior Full-Stack Architect & Lead UI Designer. Goal: Transform the current prototype into a professional, public-facing platform. Key Directives:

Architecture: Switch to a "Search-First" flow (Public Home).

Design: Enforce a strict Minimalist White/Mint (#14b999) aesthetic. Remove all "Admin Template" clutter.

PART 1: ARCHITECTURE & ROUTING (SEARCH-FIRST)
The current "Login-Wall" is bad for UX. Open the gates.

Route / (Home): MUST render the Search Page (patient/home.html). Remove @login_required. Anyone can search.

Auth Logic:

Move Login/Register forms to dedicated routes (/login, /register).

Navbar Logic: If user is Guest, show "Se connecter" (Gray) & "S'inscrire" (Mint Button). If Logged In, show "Mes Rendez-vous".

The "Booking Gate":

Guests can see doctors.

Clicking "Prendre RDV" triggers a check.

IF Guest: Redirect to /login?next=booking.

IF User: Create Appointment -> Redirect to "Mes RDV".

PART 2: VISUAL PURGE & BRANDING (THE "CLEAN" LOOK)
Strictly apply the Brand Color: #14b999 (Mint Turquoise).

Delete Immediately:

The dark/black Footer.

The "Epidemiology Radar" section.

The Blue/Purple/Gradient backgrounds on the Dashboard tiles.

The Blue Hero section on the Home page.

Global Style:

Backgrounds: Always bg-gray-50 (Off-White).

Cards: bg-white with shadow-sm or shadow-md and rounded-xl.

Primary Buttons: Solid bg-[#14b999] (No gradients).

Text Highlights: text-[#14b999].

PART 3: TEMPLATE SPECIFIC REFACTORING
A. Public Home (patient/home.html) - The "Google" Vibe

Layout: A completely clean page.

Center: The Search Bar (White floating card) centered vertically and horizontally.

Header: Just the Logo "TBIB" and a subtitle "Trouvez votre médecin".

No clutter: No "Features", no "Testimonials".

B. Doctor Dashboard (doctor/dashboard.html) - The "Pro" Vibe

Header: White Navbar (Not Green). Logo in #14b999.

The "Patient Suivant" Button:

Massive, Full-Width on mobile.

Solid bg-[#14b999].

Text: White, Bold, Large.

Stats Cards: Refactor into clean White Cards (not colored tiles).

Label: Uppercase Gray.

Number: Huge #14b999 font.

Execute this full transformation. Logic first, then UI cleanup.
